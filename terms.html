            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="legal-date">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Apex Growth website and services.
                By accessing our website or engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Services</h2>
            <p>Apex Growth provides digital marketing services including, but not limited to, performance marketing, web
                design, search engine optimization, content strategy, and marketing automation. The specific scope,
                deliverables, and terms of each engagement will be outlined in a separate service agreement or proposal.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Strategy Call Bookings</h2>
            <p>By submitting a strategy call booking request through our website, you agree to provide accurate and
                truthful information. Strategy calls are provided at no charge and carry no obligation to purchase
                services. We reserve the right to decline or reschedule strategy calls at our discretion.</p>

            <h2>3. Engagement Terms</h2>
            <p>All client engagements are governed by individual service agreements that specify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scope of work and deliverables</li>
                <li>Investment amount and payment terms</li>
                <li>Timeline and milestones</li>
                <li>Responsibilities of both parties</li>
                <li>Termination and cancellation policies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our standard engagements require a 90-day minimum commitment. Specific terms may vary and will be
                detailed in your service agreement.</p>

            <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>Payment terms, including amounts, schedules, and methods, are specified in individual service agreements.
                Late payments may be subject to service suspension. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise stated
                in your service agreement.</p>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content on the Apex Growth website — including text, graphics, logos, design elements, and code — is
                the property of Apex Growth and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce,
                distribute, or create derivative works from our content without written permission.</p>
            <p>Work product created during client engagements is governed by the intellectual property terms in each
                service agreement. Typically, clients receive full ownership of deliverables upon final payment.</p>

            <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Clients are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing timely access to necessary accounts, assets, and information</li>
                <li>Reviewing and approving deliverables within agreed timeframes</li>
                <li>Ensuring all content and materials provided to us comply with applicable laws</li>
                <li>Making payments according to the agreed schedule</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during the engagement. This
                includes business strategies, financial data, marketing plans, and any other information marked as
                confidential. Confidentiality obligations survive termination of the engagement.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Apex Growth provides marketing services on a best-effort basis. While we strive to achieve the results
                discussed during strategy calls and outlined in proposals, we do not guarantee specific outcomes.
                Marketing results depend on numerous factors including market conditions, competition, product quality,
                and client cooperation.</p>
            <p>Our liability is limited to the fees paid for the specific services giving rise to the claim. We are not
                liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

            <h2>9. Termination</h2>
            <p>Either party may terminate a service engagement according to the terms specified in the service
                agreement. Upon termination, we will deliver all completed work product and provide a final accounting
                of any outstanding fees.</p>
